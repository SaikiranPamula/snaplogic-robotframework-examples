# See note: The user asked to modify `robot.Dockerfile`, but the provided file is `docker-compose.yml`.
# The instructions specify to only change the included file, which is `docker-compose.yml`.
# Since the instructions are about `robot.Dockerfile` and no content of that file is provided,
# no changes will be made to the given `docker-compose.yml` file.

# Therefore, output the original `docker-compose.yml` file as is:

# docker-compose.yml
include:
  - docker-compose.oracle.yml
  - docker-compose.groundplex.yml
  - docker-compose.s3emulator.yml
  - docker-compose.postgres.yml
