# Travis CI and Slack Notifications Setup

## Overview
This document explains the Travis CI configuration and Slack notification setup for the SnapLogic Robot Framework project.

## Files Merged
1. `.travis.yml` - Main Travis CI configuration
2. `post_test_results_notify.yml` - Slack notification configuration (now merged into .travis.yml)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed External Import
The original `.travis.yml` had:
```yaml
import:
  - SnapLogic/slim-tx-engine:travis/post_test_results_notify.yml
```
This external import was removed and replaced with direct notification configuration.

### 2. Added Slack Notifications
The Slack notification configuration from `post_test_results_notify.yml` has been directly integrated into `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
notifications:
  slack:
    rooms:
      - secure: "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_SLACK_TOKEN"
    on_success: always
    on_failure: always
    on_error: always
    on_pull_requests: false
    template:
      - "Build <%{build_url}|#%{build_number}> (<%{compare_url}|%{commit}>) of %{repository_slug}@%{branch}"
      - "by %{author} %{result} in %{duration}"
      - "Message: %{commit_message}"
      - "View results: %{build_url}"
```

### 3. Enhanced Build Configuration
Added:
- `after_success` and `after_failure` hooks for better debugging
- `after_script` for cleanup
- Cache configuration for faster builds
- More detailed script execution

## Slack Integration Details

### Notification Triggers
- **on_success: always** - Notifies when build succeeds
- **on_failure: always** - Notifies when build fails
- **on_error: always** - Notifies when build errors occur
- **on_pull_requests: false** - Disables notifications for PR builds

### Message Template
The notification includes:
- Build number and URL
- Commit information
- Repository and branch
- Author and result
- Build duration
- Commit message

## Troubleshooting Slack Notifications

If you're still not receiving Slack notifications:

1. **Verify Slack Token**: 
   - The secure token must be properly encrypted for your repository
   - Use Travis CLI to encrypt: `travis encrypt "WORKSPACE_ID#CHANNEL_ID#TOKEN" --add notifications.slack.rooms`

2. **Check Travis Settings**:
   - Ensure notifications are enabled in Travis settings
   - Verify the repository is active in Travis

3. **Test Notification**:
   - Make a small commit to trigger a build
   - Check Travis logs for notification errors

4. **Slack Workspace**:
   - Ensure the Travis CI app is installed in your Slack workspace
   - Check if the channel exists and the bot has access

## Usage

The merged configuration will:
1. Run Robot Framework tests
2. Send Slack notifications based on build results
3. Provide detailed build information in Slack messages

## File Cleanup

- Original `post_test_results_notify.yml` has been backed up as `post_test_results_notify.yml.backup`
- You can safely remove the backup file once notifications are working
- All notification configuration is now in `.travis.yml`

## Next Steps

1. Commit the updated `.travis.yml`
2. Push to trigger a Travis build
3. Verify Slack notifications are received
4. If issues persist, check the Travis build logs for notification errors
